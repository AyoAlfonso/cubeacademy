# Blog Post API

A laravel RESTful API for a blog post system. I am using token based authentication because we are using an SPA in the frontend.

## Features and Technical Decisions

-   `C|R|U|D` operations for blog posts, users blog categories, and blog comments. With Factory fake data generation for seeding the database
-   Using `Route::apiResource()` in the routes to keep API cleaner and more organized
-   Used Form requests for input validation
-   A Service layer for business logic (see `Services` folder)
-   Repository pattern for data access (see `Repositories` folder)
-   Custom exception handling (see `Exceptions` folder)
-   Used API response trait for consistent API responses see `ApiResponser` trait in `Traits` folder
-   Validation Custom Error handling with the failedValidation method using `ValidationException` in the `StoreCategoryRequest`, `StoreCommentRequest`, `StorePostRequest`, `StoreUserRequest`
-   Controller Custom error handling with `CustomException` class

## Setup


1. Clone the repository
2. Run `composer install`
3. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and cd into the `database` folder and run `touch database.sqlite` to create an empty sqlite database
4. Return to the root of the app and run `php artisan key:generate` and you will get a new key in your `.env` file
5. Run `php artisan migrate`
6. Run `php artisan db:seed` to seed the database with 20 users and their posts and over 300 comments
7. Run `php artisan serve` to start the development server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` e.g for all the posts `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/posts`
8. To Run `php artisan schedule:work` to run the scheduled jobs that every minute directly. Check the `app/Console/Commands/PublishScheduledPosts.php` file for how it works
9. Run `php artisan l5-swagger:generate` to generate the swagger documentation at `public/swagger.json` and 127.0.0.1:8000/api/documentation

## Architecture

The API follows a layered architecture:

1. Routes: Define API endpoints
2. Controllers: Handle HTTP requests and responses
3. Form Requests: Validate input data
4. Services: Implement business logic
5. Repositories: Handle data access and storage
6. Models: Represent database tables and relationships
7. Resources: Format API responses

This architecture promotes separation of concerns and makes the code more maintainable and testable.

## Best Practices

-   Implemented repository pattern for separation of concerns
-   Used services to encapsulate business logic
-   Used standard REST conventions for APIs
-   Used proper HTTP status codes and consistent response format using Laravel's Response Factory
-   Implemented global error handling
-   Used dependency injection for better testability see the Factory pattern in models
-   Followed PSR-12 coding standards

## Testing

Run `php artisan test tests` to execute the unit and feature tests.

Scheduler is implemented here `app/Console/Commands/PublishScheduledPosts.php`
Create a couple blogposts with the `scheduled_at` into the future maybe 2 mins into the future in this format `Y-m-d H:i:s` e.g `2024-07-24 16:22:00`

Run the command using `php artisan app:publish-scheduled-posts` to run the job directly.

Laravel will mimic a scheduler.

Run the command using `php artisan schedule:work` to put on the job in the background. In a minute you should see something like this:

```bash
[  2024-07-24 16:22:00 Running ['artisan' app:publish-scheduled-posts]  232.14ms DONE
â‡‚ '/usr/local/Cellar/php/8.3.9/bin/php' 'artisan' app:publish-scheduled-posts > '/dev/null' 2>&1
```

For the above to work, you need to set up the cron job on your machine

Go to your terminal, cd into your project and run:
crontab -e

After that press i in your keyboard in order to insert data, then paste the command below:

```bash
* * * * * php /path/to/your/laravel-project/artisan schedule:run 1>> /dev/null 2>&1
```

After that press the ESC button and write :wq (if you want to save the changes)
NB: To get full path of your project, you can run the 'pwd' command.

If you are on a macbook you can use env EDITOR=nano crontab -e to open the crontab in nano

Example CLI commands you might find useful to create files and in debbuging

```bash
# General Artisan commands
php artisan serve
php artisan migrate
php artisan migrate:fresh

# Migration generation
php artisan make:migration create_categories_table
php artisan make:controller API/AuthController

# Route Checks
php artisan route:list
php artisan route:clear

# Scheduler jobs
env EDITOR=nano crontab -e # to open crontab in nano
php artisan schedule:list

# Factory generation
php artisan make:factory PostFactory --model=Post
php artisan make:factory CategoryFactory --model=Category
php artisan make:factory CommentFactory --model=Comment

#Swagger documentation generation
php artisan l5-swagger:generate
```
